## Application Overview

The developed **CRUD API** utilizes **MongoDB** as its primary database, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval.

### Industry Best Practices

This application is built adhering to the industry's best practices, leveraging the latest architectural patterns for robustness and scalability.

### Architecture

The API implements a **Model - Service - Controller** architecture, emphasizing a clear separation of concerns. Services implementation exclusively handle interactions with the database, while the rest of the codebase is compartmentalized for improved maintainability and extensibility.

### Responsibility Focus

Each function within the codebase is meticulously designed with a singular responsibility in mind, contributing to a more organized and manageable code structure.
